Class Policities
=====

### Decision-making principles for changing course policy and plan ###
1. I will put the health–physical and mental–and safety and security of all members of Handong and our neighbors first priority, thus all class settings are subject to change depending on related threats including the COVID-19 situations. If I need to change the class setting inevitably, I will make decisions while following all requirements officially posed in the class (explained below). If there are conflicting requirements, I will ask the university to resolve the conflicts.
1. When I make a decision that matters to all class members, I will quickly announce it to the whole class. If a decision is to change major settings (e.g., evaluation criteria), I will hear from all class members and consider their opinions, and then acknowledge the chance and its consequences.
1. In addition, I will consider the personal situation of each student as much as it is affordable and  does not hurt the fairness in evaluation. If a threat of fairness arises, I will open the situation to the whole class to listen to class member’s opinions to consider them in making the final decision.
1. Last, the classes will cover as many planned topics as possible.

### Communication ###
**(1) English** <br>
English is the official language of this course. As specified in the university policy, students in a 100% English course must use English in all formal activities, for instance writing homework, assignment report, midterm and final exam answers; non-English parts will not be counted at all kinds of evaluations.
The instructor must use English in delivering class contents (e.g., lecture, assignments, exams). Students are highly recommended to use English for asking questions and participating in discussion.

Yet, to promote active participation, students are allowed to use Korean for question and class participation; in this case, the instructor will repeat Korean sayings in English. In addition, the instructor can use Korean to rephrase what he had already said in English; in this case as well, the instructor repeats what he said in Korean for double-check.

**(2) Contact with Instructor**
Use the class channel in Slack. Make questions publicly, so that I can share the question and my answer easily with all class members. For a case where privacy matters, you can send a direct message (DM) to transfer privacy-sensitive information (e.g., a proof for an approved absence). Other than this case, the instructor and the TAs will not respond to any personal contacts (e.g., Slack DM, e-mail).

**(3) Counseling session**
Students can request a counseling session to the instructor to ask for academic advice. To make an appointment with the instructor, submit an answer to the following pre-interview form: https://forms.gle/KbREJ1b5S13nD51V7. When a new submission is received, the instructor will send a reply to arrange a personal counseling session. Note that the instructor does not arrange any personal meeting at an exam season.

**(4) Improper solicitation**
All kinds of improper solicitations are strictly forbidden as declared in the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act (aka. Kim Young-ran Act). For example:
1. Students MUST NOT give a gift in any form to the instructor or TA (even a can of coffee) while they are officially students in Handong University
1. Students MUST NOT ask the instructor or TA to change their gradings or evaluation results. Meanwhile, students can claim for correcting errors in evaluation.
1. Students MUST NOT ask the instructor or TA any kind of unfair evaluations, even for exceptional cases. If you want to claim for an execution due to your exceptional circumstance, you must discuss the concern with the Student's Academic Affair Team. Only upon the official request from the Student's Academic Affair Team, the instructor may change the rule/policy for excuse. Any violation of these will be reported to the Academic Affair Team for treatments.

**(5) Teaching assistant (TA)**
TAs of the course work primarily for assisting the instructor in conducting meetings, in supporting students for accomplishing assignments, and in processing educational materials such as grading exams/quizzes/assignments. There may be help desk sessions offered by TAs if required.

**(6) Class Materials**
You MUST NOT record the audio or video of the class meeting (even for your personal use). 
  Illegal uses of the class materials are strictly prohibited. Check and uphold their copyrights.

**(7) Class Attendance**
The instructor will check the attendance of each student at every class. Each student must declare his/her attendance at a class by responding to the instructor.
Approved absence (공인출석) is accepted only if (1) the instructor confirms that your case adheres to Act 8-34 of the HGU rule, and at the same time (3) you submit the proof
